<p><h3><A name="intro">Introduction</A></h3>
This User Agreement, the eAuction User Privacy Notice and all policies posted on our sites set out the terms on which eAuction offers you access to and use of our sites, services, applications and tools (collectively Services). You can find an overview of our policies here. All policies and the eAuction User Privacy Notice are incorporated into this User Agreement. You agree to comply with all the above when accessing or using our Services. You are entering into a contract with eAuction address Oxford Road Manchester M13 9PL company number 123456789 , VAT number 123456798, business licence number 123456789.</p><br>

<p><h3><A name="about">About eAuction</A></h3>
eAuction does not have possession of anything listed or sold through eAuction. The contract for the sale is directly between buyer and seller. While we may provide pricing, postage, drafting and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. eAuction does not review users' listings or content. While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programmes, eAuction has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised, the truth or accuracy of users' content, listings or feedback, the ability of sellers to sell items, the ability of buyers to pay for items, or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.

Under the eAuction Money Back Guarantee if we resolve a case in the buyer's favour, we may remove funds from the seller's PayPal account to reimburse the buyer for the cost of the item and the original postage cost in accordance with the seller's authorisation provided to us under this.</p><br>

<p><h3><A name="use">Using eAuction</A></h3>
In connection with using or accessing the Services, you will not:
<ul>
<li>post, list or upload content or items in inappropriate categories or areas on our sites.</li>

<li>breach or circumvent any laws, third party rights or our systems or policies.</li>

<li>sell any counterfeit items or otherwise infringe the copyright, trademark or other rights of third parties.</li>

<li>use our Services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts (for example if you are under 18), or are temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using our Services.</li>

<li>fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eAuction policy, for example, the seller has materially changed the item's description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made, or you cannot contact the seller (see our unpaid item policy).</li>

<li>fail to deliver items sold by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eAuction policy, for example, unless the buyer fails to follow the posted terms, or you cannot contact the buyer.</li>

<li>manipulate the price of any item or interfere with any other user's listings.</li>

<li>post false, inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, or libellous content.</li>

If you are trading as a business on eAuction, you must comply with all applicable laws relating to online trading for the site you are selling on (please see Listings, Items and the Law for more information on the legal requirements for selling in the UK).</p>

<p>You agree that we will commence supplying our services to you as soon as you accept this User Agreement. You can cancel this User Agreement under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013. We can recoup the cost of any services provided up to the point of cancellation.</p>

<p>We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time or to modify or discontinue eBay Services.</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="abuse">Abusing eAuction</A></h3>
Without limiting other remedies, we may limit, suspend, or terminate our Services and user accounts, restrict or prohibit access to, and your activities on, our Services, cancel bids and remove listings, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with the account, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and legal steps to keep you from using our Services if:
<ul>
<li>we think that you are creating problems or possible legal liabilities.</li>

<li>we think that such restrictions will improve the security of the eAuction community or reduce our or another eAuction user's exposure to financial liabilities.</li>

<li>we think that you are infringing the rights of third parties.</li>

<li>we think that you are acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this User Agreement or our policies or abuse our employees or users.</li>

<li>despite our reasonable endeavours, we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us.</li>

<li>or you fail to make full payment of any fees due for our Services by your payment due date.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>When a buyer or seller issue arises we may consider the user’s performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement, and to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="fees">Fees</A></h3>
The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Seller fees page. We may change our fees, or introduce new fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eAuction site or via the My eAuction page  30 days in advance. You may close your account without penalty within 30 days of such notice being given. You are required to have a PayPal account on file when selling on eAuction. If your payment method fails or your account is overdue, we may collect fees owed by charging your PayPal account, retaining collection agencies or legal counsel.</p><br>

<p><h3><A name="listing">Listing Conditions</A></h3>
When listing an item, you agree to comply with the rules for listing and selling practices policy and that:
<ul>
<li>you are responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of the item listed and agree to list in accordance with the prohibited and restricted Items policy.</li>

<li>your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for up to 24 hours. eAuction does not guarantee exact listing durations.
content that violates any of eAuction's policies may be deleted at eAuction's discretion.</li>

<li>Where your listing appears in search and browse results may be based on certain factors such as listing format, title, bidding activity, end time, keywords, price and postage cost, Feedback, and detailed seller ratings.</li>

<li>eAuction's duplicate listing policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results.</li>
</ul></p><br>


<p><h3><A name="purchasing">Purchasing Conditions</A></h3>
When buying an item, you agree to comply with the rules for buyers and that:<ul>

<li>you are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or commitment to buy.</li>

<li>you enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item, or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted).</li></ul></p><br>

<p><h3><A name="content">Content</A></h3>
When providing us with content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual (or for the duration of any copyright or other rights in such content), irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to use the content and authorise us to exercise any and all copyright, trademark, publicity, database or other rights you have in or to the content in any media known now or in the future. Further, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you waive your moral rights in the content and promise not to assert such rights against us, our sublicensees or assignees. We may offer catalogues of stock images, descriptions and product specifications, which are provided by third-parties (including eAuction users). You may use catalogue content solely in connection with your eAuction listings during the time your listings are on eAuction's sites.</p>

<p>While we try to offer reliable data, we cannot promise that the catalogues will always be accurate and up-to-date, and you agree that you will not hold our catalogue providers or us responsible for inaccuracies in their catalogues. If you choose to include catalogue content in your listings, you continue to be responsible for ensuring that your listings are accurate, do not include misleading information and fully comply with this User Agreement and all eAuction policies. The catalogue may include copyrighted, trademarked or other proprietary materials. You agree not to remove any copyright, proprietary or identification markings included within the catalogues or create any derivative works bases on catalogue content (other than by including them in your listings).
</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="restricting">Restricting Funds</A></h3>
To protect against the risk of liability, eAuction has at times requested, and may continue to request, that PayPal restrict access to funds in a seller's PayPal account based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, riskiness of the listing category, or the filing of a case. This may result in PayPal determining to restrict funds in your PayPal account in order to manage PayPal's risk exposure pursuant to PayPal policies.
</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="returns">Returns</A></h3>
eAuction offers a managed returns process to simplify returns for buyers and sellers.

<br>With the eAuction managed returns process, a seller accepting returns can manage and track the return through an automated process on the site. If the buyer returns an item because it does not match the listing description, sellers will generally be responsible for return postage costs.
eAuction may automatically apply the eAuction managed returns process to certain categories of sellers and require those sellers to use the process to manage their returns. If the eAuction managed returns process is automatically applied to your listings, you:<ul>
<li>agree to the eAuction managed returns process terms and conditions.</li>
<li>authorise eAuction to include return postage charges and auto-refunds on your seller invoice as a fee, which may be charged to your PayPal account</li>
<li>acknowledge that the eAuction Money Back Guarantee has special provisions to accommodate a case if an item is successfully returned through eAuction’s managed return process and a timely refund isn’t issued.</li></ul></p>
See Using the managed returns process for more details.</p><br>

<p><h3><A name="moneyback">eAuction Money Back Guarantee</A></h3>
Most eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, the eBay Money Back Guarantee helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve issues. The eBay Money Back Guarantee policy is part of this User Agreement and incorporated by reference. Buyers and sellers agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any case.
 
<br>Sellers must have a PayPal account registered with eBay. Sellers may change this PayPal account by contacting eAuction. If we resolve a case in the buyer's favour, eAuction may notify PayPal of the relevant case and remove funds from the seller's PayPal account to reimburse the buyer for the full cost of the item, and postage. For this purpose, you, in the capacity of a seller:<ul>
<li>authorise and instruct us and PayPal to collect or reverse variable amounts (representing payments related to covered claims) from your PayPal account to carry out a buyer reimbursement.</li>
<li>authorise and instruct us to request PayPal to collect or reverse variable amounts in other currency holdings (representing payments related to eligible claims) from your PayPal account to carry out a buyer reimbursement where you do not have sufficient funds available in the transaction currency.</li>
<li>authorise and instruct us to request PayPal to restrict your access to funds (the restriction will apply up to a sum equivalent to the cost of the item and original postage costs paid by the buyer) in your PayPal account at any point during the resolution process. (This may result in PayPal determining to restrict funds in your PayPal account in order to manage PayPal's risk exposure pursuant to PayPal policies. See Restricting funds.)</li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that your authorisations above will be made on a recurring basis and on various dates as required by us to implement the terms of the eAuction Money Back Guarantee policy. For future claims, where we resolve a dispute in the buyer's favour, we will notify the seller and continue to charge the seller's preferred method of payment. If sellers do not provide eAuction with a valid reimbursement method, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies. We may suspend the eAuction Money Back Guarantee policy without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.</li></ul>
</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="mistakes">Correcting mistakes in payments to buyers and sellers</A></h3>
 
We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the PayPal account used for the eBay Money Back Guarantee refund or reimbursement.
</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="liability">Liability</A></h3>
We try to keep eAuction and its Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services. Bid update and other notification functionality in eAuction's Services may not occur in real time. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond eAuction's control.
We (including our affiliates, directors, agents and employees) shall not be liable to you in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise for any business losses, such as loss of data, profits, revenue, business, opportunity, goodwill, reputation or business interruption or for any losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by us arising, directly or indirectly from:<ul>
<li>your use of or your inability to use our Services.</li>
<li>pricing, postage or other guidance provided by eAuction.</li>
<li>delays or disruptions in our Services.</li>
<li>viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing, or linking to, our Services.</li>
<li>glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our Services.</li>
<li>damage to your hardware device from the use of any eAuction.</li>
<li>the content, actions, or inactions of third parties, including items listed using our Services or the destruction of allegedly fake items.</li>
<li>a suspension or other action taken with respect to your account or breach of the Abusing eAuction section.</li>
<li>the duration or manner in which your listings appear in search results as set out in the Listing conditions section.</li>
<li>your need to modify practices, content, or behaviour or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies.</li>
<li>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. This is especially so if you are a consumer.</li>
<li>You accept sole responsibility for the legality of your actions under laws applying to you and the legality of any items you list on any of our sites.</li>
<li>Although we use techniques that aim to verify the accuracy and truth of the information provided by our users, user verification on the internet is difficult. eAuction cannot and does not confirm, and is not responsible for ensuring, the accuracy or truthfulness of users' purported identities or the validity of the information which they provide to us or post on our sites.</li>
<li>Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under eAuction Money Back Guarantee up to the price the item sold for on eBay and its original postage costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) £100.</li>
<li>Nothing in this User Agreement shall limit or exclude our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees or for any other liability that cannot be limited or excluded by law.</li></ul></p><br>


<p><h3><A name="compensation">Compensation</A></h3>
You will compensate us in full (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) for any losses or costs, including reasonable legal fees, we incur arising out of any breach by you of this User Agreement, your improper use of eAuction's Services or your breach of any law or the rights of a third party.</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="legaldisputes">Legal Disputes</A></h3>
If a dispute arises between you and eAuction, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by contacting Customer Support. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation. Any claim, dispute or matter arising under or in connection with this User Agreement shall be governed and construed in all respects by the laws of England and Wales. You and eAuction both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.
In simple terms, "non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts" means that if you were able to bring a claim arising from or in connection with this User Agreement against us in Court, an acceptable court would be a court located in England, but you may also elect to bring a claim in the court of another country instead. English law will apply in all cases.</p><br>
 
<p><h3><A name="general">General</A></h3>
If any provision of this User Agreement is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.<br>

Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.<br>

The policies posted on our sites may be changed from time to time. Changes take effect when we post them on the eAuction site.<br>

A person who is not a party to this User Agreement has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this User Agreement but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party specified in this User Agreement or which exists or is available apart from that Act.<br>
The User Agreement, the eAuction User Privacy Notice and all policies posted on our site are the entire agreement between you and eAuction and supersede all prior understandings and agreements of the parties.<br>
The following Sections survive any termination of this User Agreement: Fees (with respect to fees owed for our services), Content, Liability, Compensation, Legal disputes and the release contained in this General section.<br>
Legal notices shall be served by registered mail to eAuction. We shall send notices to you by email to the email address you provide to eAuction during the registration process.
